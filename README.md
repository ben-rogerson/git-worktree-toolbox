ðŸŒ³ **Git Worktree Toolbox** is a MCP server and CLI for managing git worktrees.

Create isolated workspaces without the hassle of stashing changes and switching branches.

Ideal for AI-assisted development workflows requiring multiple features in parallel.

As a backup, use the `gwtree` command to run any of the mcp tools yourself.

## Available MCP Tools (9)

- `list` - List projects and their worktrees
- `new` - Create a new worktree with a matching branch
- `archive` - Archive worktrees and branches
- `go` - Open worktree folder in your editor
- `changes` - Review changes and optionally commit and push
- `grab` - Pull in changes from a specific worktree
- `pr` - Generate a link to create a pull/merge request
- `doctor` - Fix worktree metadata issues
- `clean` - Archive unused worktrees

## Get Started

Add the MCP Server to Cursor / Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "git-worktree-toolbox": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "git-worktree-toolbox@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

The `gwtree` command can be used after a global installation:

```bash
npm install -g git-worktree-toolbox
```

Run `gwtree help` to see the available tools and their flags.
